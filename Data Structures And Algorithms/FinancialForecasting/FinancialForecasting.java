###RECURSION###
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve
smaller instances of the same problem. It simplifies complex problems by breaking
them down into base cases and recursive steps.
-->Simplifies logic for repetitive patterns like Fibonacci series
-->Reduces code size by replacing loops.
-->Naturally fits problems where the solution depends
on previous computations.

Analaysis
Recursive algorithms provide a clean, elegant way to model financial forecasting.
However, they must be used carefully for performance reasons. For predictable, linear
projections like compound growth, recursion works well but may benefit from optimization
for large input sizes.
